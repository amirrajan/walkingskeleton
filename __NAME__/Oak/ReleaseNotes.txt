=============== CHANGES ==================
- Camibum and company now plays nice with auto properties.
  If you get the Invalid column name Exception when saving a Gemini, 
  you can remove properties from Gemini's using the Exclude() method.  
  Override your repository's GetAttributesToSave()
  these columns from being persisted.
  Example: https://github.com/amirrajan/Oak/blob/master/Sample%20Apps/BorrowedGames/BorrowedGames/Repositories/WantedGames.cs
- Added InitializeExtensions method. If you want to leverage mix-ins, 
  this method need to be explicitly called in the constructor of classes
  that use *static* auto properties. Invocation is automatically done
  if you use dynamic properties.
- The Expando property in Gemini is now named Prototype.
- Case invariant dictionary is used now to store dynamic properties (ie Prototype).
